# Rovenhell
Rovenhell is a server-authoritative MMO game server architecture, powered by Unreal Engine 5.  
Instead of using Unreal's Replication system, Rovenhell uses custom-written netcodes to synchronize around 200 players per dedicated server.  
  
The project is **NOT** intended to serve as a networking foundation; it is a prototype designed to test a distributed, dedicated-server-based MMO architecture. It has been discontinued due to architectural limitations discovered during implementation.
